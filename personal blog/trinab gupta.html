<p>I am an assistant professor in the Department of Computer Science at the University of California, Santa Barbara.Most recently, I was a postdoctoral researcher in the Systems Security and Privacy research group at MSR Redmond, where I spent one year.</p>
<p>I received my PhD in Computer Science from The University of Texas at Austin, where I was advised by Michael Walfish and Lorenzo Alvisi.</p>

<h4>Research Interests</h4>
<p>My research interests are in computer systems, security, and privacy. I enjoy taking theoretical constructs from the literature (e.g., cryptography) and carefully applying them to add strong security and privacy properties to computer systems. An example system that I built is Popcorn: a Netflix-like media delivery service that serves movies without requiring to know which movies users are requesting!</p>
